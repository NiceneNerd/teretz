# Of the Nations of Anmahta at the Time of Tereth

An account of the nations of Anmahta as they stood when Eléos called Tereth out of Anath:

## Aeírwá

Aeírwá was the oldest nation of Teretz, being established shortly after the Rending. As some men began to travel out of Lanísan, no few remained, being pleased with the land. These built cities and great works, achieving even before the elves glories which all later ages envied. But when the elves came, it was to Lanísan first of all, for it was the most populous land. With the aid of the elves the cities and works became even greater, so that Anndri, the River City, was sometimes called Myü Gra (New Eden). Anndri was made the capital of Aeírwá, first and greatest of the nations of Teretz. There was the worship of Eléos held purest for generations, and they strove longest of coastal nations against the Anathim. Many splendid tales remain of their wars against Anath. Most famous among them is the Battle of Andaimé, in which Elaphíl the Hardy perished to defend the great River Tower from the black fire of Anath.

## Noëlunn

Aeírwa is bounded at the northeast by the river Hyêmi, beyond which forests thicken, rivers multiply, and the coastline lengthens. The men who moved here became great mariners, and scraps of lore tell that among them some few passed far beyond Anmahta to discover the two Teretzan continents of which no tales are known in our world. On a cliff at the eastmost edge of the ocean, they built the city of Miẅenâ. So the sea people were united to the banner of their lords at Miẅenâ and became the nation of Noëlunn. Miẅenâ was their only great city, but it was fair and tall and strong. The people of Noëlunn were a simple and happy folk, being largely ignored by the tyranny of the Anathim. Nonetheless they were not always faithful to Eléos. For the Noëlunnim were the first to worship the sea elves, by which error the great kingdom of Ôbemírach was mortally wounded.

## Négzam

Négzam is a small country to the northwest of Aeírwá. It was settled mostly by wanderers, exiles, and even outlaws who held no love for Aeírwá but could not or would not pass into Ménêth. Life there was simple but hard, and the Négzamin were a gloomy folk. They had little crime, but this often from fear, not good-will. Every clan saw to its own, and few showed hospitality or generosity. Instead those who came unbidden to land not their own were met with questions, threats, or even death. If every any business arose concerning the whole people, the heads of each clan would travel to the capital city of Fêmánk for a gathering. They had no king or any lords, and most decrees of a gathering were made by the appeal of strong words and a mighty will. The Négzamin detested the Anathim but also feared not Eléos. They cared for nothing beyond their borders and indeed could not even be bought. No tales are known of Négzam except for a single, very late, war with Aeírwá and for their role in the journey of Kaulav of Addríel to Sümlamené.

## Ménerâch

After the coming of the elves, men were able to pass into Ménêth. At first few would stay, most being eager to move on to more friendly land to the west. But those who tried to settle there became elf-friends and learned from them the art of stonecraft, so that they became mighty masters of rock. On the lower peaks they carved out whole cities, hard and glorious strongholds cut cleanly out of mountain flesh. In time there were several cities as these, and they joined themselves as the League of Ménerâch. The highest and largest of these cities, Vaëlü, became the capital, whence reigned their first king, Auvirân. For many years the Ménerâchim valiantly resisted the Anathim, but in time King Hyolphü was purchased by multiplied threats and promises. So Ménerâch became a chief ally of Anath and a terror to its own neighbors.

## Adir Chlif 

As Ménerâch grew in might and severity, some of its clans despised the League and its king. These traveled further west and began to settle in small, independent tribes. From time to time they came together for common affairs, but daily they lived as free men, under neither king nor court. They called i the tribes of Adir Chlif, that is, the Free North. Rarely do they enter into any tales, for they cling closely to their hills and do not often do beyond nor permit strangers to pass. For a time they continued the worship of El
