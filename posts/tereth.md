# Of the Call of Tereth

In the year that Aeírwá forsook its war with the Anathim and became tributary to their empire, Eléos spoke. There was a small village near the southern tip of Anath where a young widow lived alone. Eléos appeared and said to her, "Go up to the Temple at Dríthu. A man there shall say to you, 'How comes one so beautiful alone to the Temple?' You shall say to him, 'I am alone because my husband died. But at this Temple I have met another.' If he says, 'I am glad at your good fortune. Be merry and blessed,' then say no more to him. But if he says to you, 'Who is he? For I would marry you myself,' then you shall do according to his word."

Then the woman said to Eléos, "I am only a young woman. Who shall go up with me?"

Eléos answered and said, "I myself will go with you as far as the <abbr title="Road to Dríthu">Kîr Dríthu</abbr>." So Eléos walked with her until the road at the foot of the mountain. She did not even remember the journey for the joy of His presence. Though she wished to thank Him, when she turned back to look at Him, He was no more.

The woman walked the rest of the way to the Temple. The journey took one more day. When she arrived, she walked to the pool and looked at the men around it. They all began to gaze upon her, for she was very beautiful. Then the tallest came to her and said, "How comes one so beautiful alone to the Temple?" She answered, "I came here alone because my husband is dead. But now I have met another." And the man said, "I am glad at your good fortune. Be merry and blessed." So he departed.

Seeing him walk away, the strongest man left came to her and said, "How comes one so beautiful alone to the Temple?" So she answered, "I came here alone because my husband is dead. But now I have met another." He likewise said, "I am glad. Be blessed." And so also said four other men, until only one man remained.

The last man, seeing all the others had spoken to the woman and left, looked up and said to himself, "Surely this woman fears Eléos, for she has turned away all who sought her, as the woman of the <abbr title='Free ones'>Adim</abbr>[*](#fm1) accept all men without distinction." Then he came to her and said, "How comes one so beautiful alone to the Temple?"

The woman said to him as to the others, "I came here alone because my husband is dead. But now I have met another." This time the man answered, "Who have you met? For I have seen six men come to you and leave saddened. Did you really meet another before you even came to the Temple? Surely he would have come with you beyond the gates. I must know who he is, for I would marry you myself."

So the man returned with the young widow to her home and married her there. She conceived and bore a son, and they called his name Tereth.[*](#fm2) The child grew wise and strong, and he was the greatest in magic among all his peers.

When Tereth was grown, he ascended to the Temple at Dríthu to obtain a wife, as was the custom among the Anathim. He arrived at the time of a great sacrifice, the <abbr title="Youth Festival">Thermüvû</abbr>. At the sacrifice, there were 300 altars. Upon each altar was a girl of no more than two years. Each man was to slay the child and pour the blood into the Drüthu pool. By this his magic would grow stronger, and all the people would return to their labors with greater power for the next year.

When Tereth approached the altars and saw the girls, he said to himself, "How should it be that I would take a woman in the same place that I would destroy what is born of woman?"

As he pondered this, the word of Eléos came to him, saying, "You shall not harm any child, nor shall you take a woman here. For the cry of innocent blood has come up before me, and this land shall be cursed. But you shall leave this land, sail beyond the Wall of Storms, and settle on the first island you see. There you shall find a wife, and you will have children far beyond the number all those the Anathim have ever slain. Your descendants shall return to this land and cleanse it, and after it has been cleansed, they shall dwell here forever."

So Tereth left the Temple and returned to his home. He kissed his father and mother, took one of their slaves, and purchased a small boat. He took this boat to the shore of the sea and set sail.

After four days, he arrived at the Wall of Storms and said a prayer to Eléos. He was never seen among the Anathim again, nor does any tale tell of what befell him when he sailed into the clouds. But on an island a three-day's journey from the the Wall of Storms, there arose shortly a people known as the Terethim, who claimed Tereth as their father and praised Eléos for delivering him through the terrible barrier of Anath. So the Terethim multiplied and grew strong, and soon they became the enemy of the Anathim.

[[*]](#fm2) This name seems probably to be related to the name "Teretz," so that it carries some significance like "earth" or "world."
