# Of the Terethim and their Mission

After the call of Tereth by Eléos, his children the Terethim multipled and grew strong. At first they dwelt on a small island in the Oëlímeth northwest of Anath, a few days' sailing past the Wall of Storms. There they restored the worship of Eléos until Anath heard. 

When the Anathim first heard tell of the Terethim, they sent a single ship armed with black fire to destroy their island. But, Dráwzaf, the first chief of the Terethim known by name, being warned in a dream, led the people to flee the island by night.

From thence the Terethim spent their years as roaming seafarers, traveling from island to island, liberating the island peoples from Anath's power and teaching the worship of Eléos. At each island, some remained to guard and keep them, while most of the Terethim continued sailing.

At first in Anath it was said that the Terethim were but a rumor and a tale. But as they found more and more islands strong, independent, protected, and dedicated to Eléos, the name of the Terethim became more like that of a ghost. They ever sought them, but only a few times ever found them.

The greatest of these few confrontations was the Battle of Înnum,[*](#fm1) in which the Anathim set the entire island of Înnum ablaze with Ílnae. As the flames spread, Dráwzaf led his children in a song of praise to Eléos, and the inferno continued without consuming even a single stick or leaf. The enranged Anathim attempted to cast a curse that should sink the island, but as the children's song came to a close, the curse came back upon the Anathim's ship and sent it to the bottom of the sea.

From Dráwzaf's first flight to the complete liberation of the islands of Oëlímeth was 64 years. The elderly Dráwzaf then passed the leadership to Aldeïr, who would lead the Terethim in the [conquest of Dríthu](druthu.md).

Once the Terethim had finished conquering Anath, many of the surviving Anathim fled across the sea to the continental nations of Anmahta. In some of these nations they were immediately captured and put to death with great celebration. They passed through others as exiles and wanderers, often moving until they found abandoned places to settle. But in Ménerâch, Béwae, and Mahtaelên, the Anathim were welcomed and given high places. These nations came to be great enemies of the Terethim.

Most of the nations were glad of Anath's fall, but they did not all wholly trust the Terethim. Their first allies were Mormüin and Annichlif. Common wisdom held that Aeírwá would quickly love Tereth for the restoration of Eléos worship, but serving the Anathim for so long left them wary. Thus begun the long work of Tereth to heal the wounds the Anathim left behind, especially restoring the name of Eléos and ending *Fyüyân*, the worship of magicians.

The struggle against *Fyüyân* was the center of all Tereth's later works. At times, this was glorious. When the Cruel Wizards were expelled from Widrí and a temple of Eléos built there by the influence of Tereth's King Afím, there was great rejoicing in both Mormüin and Tereth. But the later wars, chief among them against the Moon War against Ménerâch, were so terrible that many came to blaspheme Eléos. Likewise, the poisoning of the river Nyurkménk, which caused most of even the women and children in Mahtaelên to perish, led the prophet Knulnur to call an earthquake that shattered the towers of Dríthu.

## Of the Terethim's Holiness and Faith

The Terethim were set apart by Eléos with many peculiar customs. The most visible of these were in war. Eléos forbade the use of any kind of war magic, and He required all Terethim men of fighting age to go about with shaved heads. The men of the Anathim, by contrast, grew their hair long, as it was said this would invigorate their magical prowess.

Though magic was forbidden from war, Eléos not only permitted but commanded its use in peace. The most important commands were those regarding crops and land. The Terethim were required in every field of sufficient size to provide a small magic garden and well, following His own design and spell, that would supply only the poor, the lame, the fatherless, and the widows.

The worship regulations of the Terethim were elaborate and complex, and few details are preserved. Most of the rules were negative: forbidding rituals and practices especially associated with the Anathim, and all use of images or representations of Eléos.

Among many of the psalms and hymns of the Terethim was the refrain, "Salvation is not from us or this world, but Eléos shall come from beyond."[*](#fm2) When the Ídaëchethim accepted the Îmeth message from Earth, they took this line as a prophecy of the Ídaëcheth.

## Of the Terethim in War

Since the Terethim armies were not led by mighty magicians as the Anathim, they were led instead by the priests of Eléos. These priests would sing on their way and end each march by calling for a great shout. Often after this shout, their enemies would largely fall by some great miracle in which the Terethim made no move or action. After this, the army would advance to capture the survivors and take any remaining plunder.
