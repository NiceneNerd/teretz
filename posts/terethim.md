# Of the Terethim and their Mission

After the call of Tereth by Eléos, his children the Terethim multipled and grew strong. At first they dwelt on a small island in the Oëlímeth northwest of Anath, a few days' sailing past the Wall of Storms. There they restored the worship of Eléos until Anath heard.
